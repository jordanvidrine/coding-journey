Spent the first part of the day working through Eloquent Javascript chapters 8-9 on error handling and the dreaded regex. Not a huge fan of working with regex as it is pretty confusing but I do understand it and its purposes.

#### Continued working on Node.js Course
In the course today I went through more of using express inside of node. It is starting to get a little complex, which I like because it causes me to stretch my thinking and helps me to not get bored.

The task was to create a basic app front end and backend. In the backend we created a .get('/weather') route where we send a search query and we are returned the weather info in JSON for what we entered in. Here's what that looked like.

```
app.get('/weather', (req,res) => {
  if (!req.query.address) {
    return res.send({
      error: "You must provide an address!"
    })
  }
  //run geocode function, passing in the address from the browser
  geocode(req.query.address, (error,data = {}) => {
    if (error) {
      //return error message if no address was entered
      return res.send({error})
    }
    //if geocode worked correctly, then use the data from it to
    //invoke the forecast function
    forecast(data.latitude, data.longitude, (forecastError, forecastData = {}) => {
      if (forecastError) {
        return res.send({error})
      }
      res.send({
        city: data.location,
        forecast:forecastData,
        'Search Provided': req.query.address,
      })
    })
  });
})
```

For the front-end we use fetch to make a call to that get route we established with express on the backend. Here is how that looks.

```
function getWeather(address) {
  fetch('http://localhost:3000/weather?address='+address).then((response)=>{
    let infoHtml = document.getElementById('weatherInfo')
    response.json().then((data) => {
      if (data.error) {
        infoHtml.innerHTML = data.error;
        return;
      } else {
        infoHtml.innerHTML = `The weather in ${data['Search Provided']} is: ${data.forecast}`
      }
    })
  });
}

const weatherForm = document.querySelector('form')
const search = document.querySelector('input')

weatherForm.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  let location = search.value;
  let data = getWeather(location);
  search.value = '';
})
```
