Today I spent the majority of my time coding a calculator app using a basic react setup. It was the first time I used react without installing create-react-app with npm. It was super minimal and fun to work with. I used an npm jsx converter while working on it for the desktop version. The app.js file used online is actually the converted app.js I made using JSX.

The app is actually now live [here!](https://jordanvidrine.github.io/calculator/index.html)

And the code is [here!](https://github.com/jordanvidrine/jordanvidrine.github.io/tree/master/calculator)

I also created myself a github webpage as apart of this process. I will be posting my apps and projects online now to act as a portfolio of sorts. That is here [jordanvidrine.github.io](https://jordanvidrine.github,io)
