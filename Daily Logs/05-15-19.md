Going through Chapter 6 in Eloquent Javascript today. This is my second read through of the chapter and things are getting clearer and beginning to stick.

Some things I've begun to solidify today are:
1. Classes
2. Prototypes
3. Overridding derived Prototypes
4. Polymorphism

Some things I need to better solidify are
1. Symbols (Didnt even know they existed before this chapter)


I ran the following code a couple of times through the chrome debugger and was able to understand it.

```
class Matrix {
  constructor(width, height, element = (x, y) => undefined) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.content = [];

    for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
      for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        this.content[y * width + x] = element(x, y);
      }
    }
  }

  get(x, y) {
    return this.content[y * this.width + x];
  }
  set(x, y, value) {
    this.content[y * this.width + x] = value;
  }
}
class MatrixIterator {
  constructor(matrix) {
    this.x = 0;
    this.y = 0;
    this.matrix = matrix;
  }

  next() {
    if (this.y == this.matrix.height) return {done: true};

    let value = {x: this.x,
                 y: this.y,
                 value: this.matrix.get(this.x, this.y)};
    this.x++;
    if (this.x == this.matrix.width) {
      this.x = 0;
      this.y++;
    }
    return {value, done: false};
  }
}

Matrix.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
  return new MatrixIterator(this);
};

let matrix = new Matrix(2, 2, (x, y) => `value ${x},${y}`);
for (let {x, y, value} of matrix) {
  console.log(x, y, value);
}
// → 0 0 value 0,0
// → 1 0 value 1,0
// → 0 1 value 0,1
// → 1 1 value 1,1

```

I've learned through Gordon Zhu's Watch and Code lessons that reading other people's code, and reading more complex code than you can easily grasp is an excellent way to get better at programming.
