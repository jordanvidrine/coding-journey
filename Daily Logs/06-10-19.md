Man, is this year flying by! I've got to put some time into my artspark project so this week will be a slow one for me coding-wise. This morning I wrote a little script to help my wife pick a winner for a drawing she did with her business. We had 266 email submissions as well as another 50+ Facebook & Instagram submissions.

I used a [CSV to JSON converter](https://csvjson.com/csv2json) to parse through the email list and convert that into an array of names. We then added to that array by using a simple html input I made. We entered the user name, and the amount of submission, and the submit button would push that (x) amount of times into the array of submits.

I then picked a random user from the array with the simple``` Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length)```

I also updated the styling of my calculator app, and redormatted my LinkedIn profile and resume to reflect my current career path.
