I started off the day working on the Drum Machine App I began work on last week. I implemented a click and drag volume knob, as well as the ability to hover over the knob and increase/decrease the volume with the mouse wheel.

I added audio elements to each pad, that when clicked will trigger the corresponding audio sample for the pad.

On the back end I added to the state a sound bank of 3 different kits the user will be able to choose from.

#### Here's the app in action so far
