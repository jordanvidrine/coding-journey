Spent the first half of the day going through 3/4 of chapter two of 'Build your own AngularJS.' Getting used to looking at fairly complex code and running a lot of functions in the jasmine debugger to see what exactly is going on behind the scenes.

Again, this isn't to learn angular or any library in particular, but to get comfortable reading, writing, and understanding complex code.
