Another 'Office Day' for me. I usually cant get much coding done on these days, BUT the Generator Manager for the company asked me to code him up something.
He needs a simple app that takes in customer information he or another employee will enter including:
1. Customer Information (Name, Phone, Location, Etc)
2. Type of Job Quote (Generator Installation, Maintenance Call, Electrical Construction)
3. If (Gen Install)
  1. Generator Information (Brand, Model, Etc)
  2. Warranty Info
  3. Notes
  4. Line Item of Project Costs

Depending on the type of work, this form will generate a web page that will be formatted so that it prints out well on a page. The information will also be saved to a SQL database we have to keep track of customers.

I created a repository for this project so I can work from work or home or away for that matter. I will be using React to accomplish this.
