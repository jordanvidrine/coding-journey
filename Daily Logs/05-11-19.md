Started the day off right at the Rayne Frog Festival. lol

Worked for a couple of hours on the Customer Quote App for my generator manager. I wrote some code to validate if the form was filled out as well as used an npm package ('email-validator') to validate the email address entered.

Also worked on correctly displaying an error when the user has not completely filled out the form yet. (I will transition to a UI version of this, but for now I will stick with simple error messages.)

#### Here is the basic unstyled page so far.

I am a little proud of writing these two functions:

```
formValidator(){

  let needsToBeCorrected = [];

  //creates an array populated with each form field that is not properly filled out
  for (let info in this.state.customerInfo) {
    //email validator
    if (info === 'email') {
      if (!validator.validate(this.state.customerInfo[info])) {
        needsToBeCorrected.push(info);
      }
    //skip the 'isValid' info in the state
    } else if (info === 'isValid') {
    } else {
      if (this.state.customerInfo[info] === '')
        needsToBeCorrected.push(info)
      }
    }

  //tests to see if the array with form fields needing correction is 0
  //which would mean the form is correctly filled out
  if (needsToBeCorrected.length === 0) {
    this.setState({
      ...this.state,
      customerInfo: {
        ...this.state.customerInfo,
        needsToBeCorrected,
        isValid: true,
      }})
    //if it needs correcting, save the state
    } else if (needsToBeCorrected.length !== 0) {
      this.setState({
        ...this.state,
        customerInfo: {
          ...this.state.customerInfo,
          needsToBeCorrected,
          isValid: false,
        }})
    }
}
```

The above function is run once 'next' is clicked. The following is rendered underneath the component if isValid remains false.

```
var warningError;
if (this.state.customerInfo.isValid === false) {
  warningError = this.state.customerInfo.needsToBeCorrected.reduce((acc,cur,idx,array) => {
  if (idx < array.length-1) {
      acc = acc + '' + ' ' + cur + ',';return acc
  } else {
    return acc + ' ' + cur + '.' + ' Once corrected, try submitting again.';
  }},'The following items need to be corrected:');
} else {
  warningError = '';
}
```
