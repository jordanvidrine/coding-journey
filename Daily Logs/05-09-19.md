# 5-9-19
Today was an office day at my day job. On my breaks I looked more into github and how to create a repository using Git Bash on windows. I created the [coding-journey](https://github.com/jordanvidrine/coding-journey) repository on my work pc and documented the work I completed on 5-8-19.

I also learned how to clone a repository on my home computer, allowing me to update this log from whatever computer I am working from.

## Creating Repository
1. Create a new reposity on Github (do not initialize with README)
2. Using Git Bash, cd to the directory you want the repository to live in and initialize
```
$ git init
```
3. Add the files in your directory. (stages for the first commit)
```
$ git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
```
4. Commit the files you've added
```
$ git commit -m "First Commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
```
5. Using the repository link from github, add it as the remote origin
```
$ git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
```
6. Ready to push the changes
```
$ git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
```

## Cloning Repository
1. cd to the folder you want your repository directory to be created in and run
```
$ git clone (repository url) [name for repository folder to create]
##[name...] is optional if you want the folder to be named something different than the repository name
```

## Pushing & Fetching
1. Pushing : After staging and comitting the files yo push run the following command:
```
git push origin [branch goes here]
```
2. Fetching: If you used git clone, you can fetch any edited or new files with the following:
```
git pull origin [branch goes here]
```
