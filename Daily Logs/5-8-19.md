Today I read through [Chapter 5](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html) of eloquent Javascript. It solidified a lot of the things about callbacks and higher-order functions in the udemy course I finished last month. I was able to solve the exercises at the end of the book without much struggle.

## Exercises
### Flattening
I used the *reduce* method, combined with the *concat* method to "flatten" an array of arrays into a single array. The code did not call for anything complex, like nested arrays.

```
let arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]]
//ex. -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]

arrays.reduce((a,b)=> a.concat(b))

```

### Your Own Loop
