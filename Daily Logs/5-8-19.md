Today I read through [Chapter 5](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html) of eloquent Javascript. It solidified a lot of the things about callbacks and higher-order functions in the udemy course I finished last month. I was able to solve the exercises at the end of the book without much struggle.

## Exercises
### Flattening
I used the *reduce* method, combined with the *concat* method to "flatten" an array of arrays into a single array. The code did not call for anything complex, like nested arrays.

```
let arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]]
//ex. -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]

arrays.reduce((a,b)=> a.concat(b))

```

### Your Own Loop
I used recursion to complete the task of creating my own looping function. Similar in operation to Javascripts own for loop.

```
function loop(val, testFn, updateFn,bodyFn) {
    if (testFn(val)) {
        bodyFn(val);
        loop(updateFn(val),testFn,updateFn,bodyFn);
    }
}

//loop(3, n => n > 0, n => n - 1, console.log);
// → 3
// → 2
// → 1
```

### Everything
I implemented an every function that takes an array and a predicate function and acts like Array.prototype.every

```
function myOwnEvery(array, test) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length ; i++) {
        if(!test(array[i])) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

console.log(myOwnEvery([1, 3, 5], n => n < 10));
// → true
console.log(myOwnEvery([2, 4, 16], n => n < 10));
// → false
console.log(myOwnEvery([], n => n < 10));
// → true
```

### Dominant Writing Direction
Using a supplied [SCRIPTS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/scripts.js) object, which included over 100 writing scripts and their corresponding info like amount of characters, writing direction, and if it is a living or dead script; I created a function that when given a string of text, parses that text and runs through the SCRIPTS object to find out A) which script was most used in that line of text and B) the writing direction of the most used script.

The dominant direction is the direction of a majority of the characters that have a script associated with them.

My solution makes use of two functions discussed earlier in the chapter. [countBy()](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_qYzPQMwIvv) and [textScripts()](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#p_T2D/Ix5YaM)

```
function dominantDirection(text){
    let direction = countBy(text, char => {
        let script = characterScript(char.codePointAt(0));
        return script ? script.direction : "none";
    })
    .filter((script) => script.name !== "none")
    .reduce((current,next) => {
        return current.count > next.count ? current : next
    })
    return direction;
}

console.log(dominantDirection("Hello!"));
// → ltr
console.log(dominantDirection("Hey, مساء الخير"));
// → rtl
```
