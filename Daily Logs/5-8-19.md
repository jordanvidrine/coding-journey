Today I read through [Chapter 5](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html) of eloquent Javascript. It solidified a lot of the things about callbacks and higher-order functions in the udemy course I finished last month. I was able to solve the exercises at the end of the book without much struggle.

## Exercises
### Flattening
I used the *reduce* method, combined with the *concat* method to "flatten" an array of arrays into a single array. The code did not call for anything complex, like nested arrays.

```
let arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]]
//ex. -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]

arrays.reduce((a,b)=> a.concat(b))

```

### Your Own Loop
I used recursion to complete the task of creating my own looping function. Similar in operation to Javascripts own for loop.

```
function loop(val, testFn, updateFn,bodyFn) {
    if (testFn(val)) {
        bodyFn(val);
        loop(updateFn(val),testFn,updateFn,bodyFn);
    }
}

//loop(3, n => n > 0, n => n - 1, console.log);
// → 3
// → 2
// → 1
```

### Everything
Implement an every function that takes an array and a predicate function and acts like Array.prototype.every

```
function myOwnEvery(array, test) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length ; i++) {
        if(!test(array[i])) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

console.log(myOwnEvery([1, 3, 5], n => n < 10));
// → true
console.log(myOwnEvery([2, 4, 16], n => n < 10));
// → false
console.log(myOwnEvery([], n => n < 10));
// → true

```
