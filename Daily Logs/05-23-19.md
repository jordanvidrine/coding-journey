Today was an office day for me, but I was able to put in a couple hours of coding in between tasks. Our company was approached by an oilfield company needing a webapp that can display information about their tanks in the field. They want a line graph representation of tank levels for the past 30 days.

I looked into D3 as I have some experience with it, but it is a little convoluted and not straightforward, which we need for others besides me not familiar with javascript to be able to continue this project once I am gone.

I found Recharts, which is a nice npm module for react that uses d3 on the backend. It includes a good amount of seemingly easy to use components to create charts and graphs out of data, rendering updates in real time.

The data structure will look like this:

Well in Field --> HMI (attached to well) --> server --> convert to database --> data delivered to web app
