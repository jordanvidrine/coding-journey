Got back to coding today after the weekend and an unexpected day of looking at financial spreadsheets for 6 hours straight yesterday. (My head was hurting)

I finalized the form fill for the first section of the generator app. Once, next is clicked, the info in the form is 'Saved' to the page and a second section to fill out will pop up with more information to be saved. This was all super straight forward and not an issue at all to implement.
