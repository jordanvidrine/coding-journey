# 5-9-19
Today was an office day at my day job. On my breaks I looked more into github and how to create a repository using Git Bash on windows. I created the [coding-journey](https://github.com/jordanvidrine/coding-journey) repository on my work pc and documented the work I completed on 5-8-19.

I also learned how to clone a repository on my home computer, allowing me to update this log from whatever computer I am working from.
