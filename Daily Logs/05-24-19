Today I worked more on the project for Sirius I wrote about yesterday. We will be using React as well as Recharts for React which uses d3 to create modular components for charts and graphs.

Today I created a fake set of data to use as a test for tank levels, and tank levelhistory. I also created a random level updater to mock when we would recieve data from the server that levels have changed. Heres what it looks like (very basic.)
