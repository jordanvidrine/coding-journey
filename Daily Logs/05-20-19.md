### 05-20-19
Back to my regular schedule this week. YES!

Today I worked through most of the exercises in the 'Beasts' section of [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/). I keep going back to this course when something im learning stumps me. I hope to finish up all of the exercises and videos by the end of next month. Once that's done I'll get back to the Udemy courses on Node/Mongo/React etc.

#### Improving Run With Debugger
Rewrite runWithDebugger so it can take an optional array that contains any arguments you want to pass into the callback function.
```
function runWithDebugger(callback, array) {
    debugger;
    if (array.length >= 0) {return callback(...array);} {return callback();}
}

function sayFullName(first,last) {
    console.log(first + ' ' + last);
}

runWithDebugger(sayFullName, ['gordon', 'zhu']); // 'gordon zhu'
```

#### Writing a library system + creating libraries out of order
My solution to the exercise with tests is [here](https://github.com/jordanvidrine/Watch-And-Code-LibraryTest)

Here is the example code for creating a library with dependencies (listed in an array). The library can be created with dependencies even before the dependencies have been loaded into the system.
```
(function(){
  var libraryStorage = {}
  function librarySystem(name,dependencies,callback) {
    //if arguments is greater than one, run through the 'definition' secion to define a library
    if (arguments.length > 1) {
      //if call includes dependencies
      if (dependencies.length > 0) {
        //checks to see if the library includes these dependencies
        if (dependencies.every(e=>libraryStorage.hasOwnProperty(e))) {
          //creates a map of the return values of each dependency
          let dependenciesMap = dependencies.map(e => librarySystem(e));
          //if it includes them, it creates a new library object w/ included info
          libraryStorage[name] = {name: name,
                                  library: callback(...dependenciesMap),
                                  dependencies: [...dependencies]}
        } else {
          //if not, it stores the information in the library, but does not define the library return value yet
          //it stores all of the information necessary to eventually run the callback and define itself
          libraryStorage[name] = {name: name,
                                  library: undefined,
                                  dependencies: [...dependencies],
                                  callback: callback}
        }
      } else {
        //if call does not include dependencies, creates the basic library
        libraryStorage[name] = {name: name,
                                library:callback(),
                                dependencies: [...dependencies]}
      }
    } else {
      if (libraryStorage[name].library === undefined ) {
        librarySystem(libraryStorage[name].name,libraryStorage[name].dependencies,libraryStorage[name].callback)
      }
      return libraryStorage[name].library
    }
  }
  window.librarySystem = librarySystem;
})()
```

#### Your Own isProtoTypeOf
Write a function, isPrototypeOf, that works just like Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf. Since your solution will be called as a function rather than a method, the way you use it will be slightly different, but the outcome should be the same.

Obviously, don't use Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf in your solution, but feel free to use other methods on Object.prototype.

I used recursion and Object.getPrototypeOf() to do this. (a) is the prototype and (b) is the object to check if prototype(a) exists in. It will recursively go deeper until it reaches the bottom to compare to (a)

```
function isPrototypeOf(a,b) {
  if (a == b) {
  	return true
  } else if (Object.getPrototypeOf(b) !== null) {
    if (Object.getPrototypeOf(b) == null) {
      return false
    }
  	return isPrototypeOf(a,Object.getPrototypeOf(b))
  } else {
  	return false;
  }
}

var canine = {
  bark: function() {
    console.log('bark');
  }
};

var dog = Object.create(canine);
dog.fetch = function() {
  console.log('fetch');
};

var myDog = Object.create(dog);
var empty = Object.create(null);

// These two lines are equivalent.
dog.isPrototypeOf(myDog);  // native function returns true
isPrototypeOf(dog, myDog); // your function does the same

// These two lines, similarly should return the same thing.
dog.isPrototypeOf(empty);  // native function returns false
isPrototypeOf(dog, empty); // your function does the same

// This should work too.
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(myDog);  // native function returns true
isPrototypeOf(Object.prototype, myDog); // your function does the same

// Also make sure that your function will work for any number of prototype links.
isPrototypeOf(canine, myDog) // true
```
